            This project is responsible for the development of five self-contained modules intended to educate students
            on the applications of AI and machine learning in the field of cyber security. Each module was designed to
            operate independently, with portable virtualization technology (Docker) ensuring consistent behavior across
            all computers and systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each module contains a set of lectures and related lab assignment, with all of the prerequisite information
            required to complete the assignment being made available in the lecture.
